# AC 2022/23 - Business Understanding


## Analysis of requirements with the end user

- As a user, I want to predict most of loan requests whose clients would not pay, so that I can minimize my bussiness losses.
- As a user, I want to predict a significant amount of loan requests whose clients would pay, so that I can maximize my business gains.

A user wants to use the system to improve their business's profits. For that, the system should correctly predict whether a loan will be paid or not. However, it's important to prioritize the loans that will not be paid, since those can significantly damage the profits.

## Definition of business goals

In terms of business, the objectives are to understand if a loan will be paid and, that way, decide if we should give the loan or not to a specific account. That way, the money spent on unpaid loans will significantly decrease. On the other hand, the company can accept a loan of a person who would otherwise be rejected and, that way, increase their profits.

## Translation of business goals into data mining goal

The main goal of the data mining to be done on this project is to determine when a Loan, associated with an Account, will end successfully, that is, will be totally paid. Therefore, the data mining goals can be defined as follows:

- Collect a dataset containing a significant amount of loans, clients and other bank information.

- Analyze the data in order to better understand it. Generate relevant statistics, tables and plots.

- Prepare and process the data based on the analysis done previously, so we can use it corretly on the predictive models.

- Build a machine learning model based on the preparation done previously, evaluate its results and review all the process done in case the results are not the expected.
